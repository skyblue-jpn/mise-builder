# Mise-Builder: NixOS Flake for Building mise Packages

This Flake is designed to build packages for various languages and tools using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) within a NixOS environment.

## Description

With this Flake, you can easily spin up a development shell on your NixOS system that contains the necessary dependencies to work with `mise`. This allows you to build and run various language runtimes and tools managed by `mise` within a consistent and reproducible environment defined in the `flake.nix` file.
Currently supported language: python, R

## Prerequisites

-   **Nix Package Manager**: NixOS must be installed.
-   **Flakes Feature Enabled**: Ensure the Flakes feature is enabled in Nix. If not, edit your `nix.conf` to include `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` and restart the Nix daemon.
-   **nix-ld**: This flake might require `nix-ld` to be activated in your environment for certain executables to run correctly. Verify that `nix-ld` is properly set up in your NixOS configuration.

## Usage

Follow these steps to enter the development shell provided by this Flake:

1.  **Enter the Development Shell**: Choose the appropriate command based on how you are using this Flake.

    **a) Standard Usage:**

    If you have cloned this Flake as a separate project or are using it in a NixOS environment without specific Home Manager integration for this Flake, navigate to its directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    nix develop
    ```

    **b) Usage with Home Manager (Potentially Required):**

    If you are managing your NixOS configuration with Home Manager and have placed this Flake within your Home Manager's configuration files, you might need to use the `--impure` flag. This is often necessary because Home Manager configurations can introduce environment dependencies that require an impure evaluation.

    ```bash
    nix develop --impure
    ```

    The need for the `--impure` flag depends on how your Home Manager configuration is set up and where this Flake is located within it. If you encounter issues with the standard `nix develop` command, try using `nix develop --impure`.

2.  **Work within the Development Shell**: Once inside the development shell, the packages defined in the `flake.nix` file will be available. You can now use `mise` commands to manage your project's language and tool versions. **If you find that specific tools managed by `mise` require additional dependencies for building or running, you should add those packages to the `requiredPackages` list within the `flake.nix` file.**

    Example:

    ```bash
    mise install nodejs@20
    mise use nodejs@20
    node -v
    ```

## Integration with `mise`

Within the development shell, `mise` can be used to manage project-specific tool versions. By creating a `mise.toml` file in your project's root directory, you can declare the required versions of languages and tools. `mise` will then ensure these are available within the environment provided by this Flake.
